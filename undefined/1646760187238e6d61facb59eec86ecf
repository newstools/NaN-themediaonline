The Standard Bank Sikuvile Journalism Awards acknowledged and honoured the bravery of journalists and their stories at the awards this past weekend. The Awards, says the South African National Editors’ Forum, are a benchmark of the best journalists, their stories and the concerns that they write for. In 2022, SANEF chairperson, Sbu Ngalwa, said, “We are now seeing green shoots and can build.” Also at the event last year, Standard Bank CEO, Lungisa Fuzile, said the pandemic robbed the country of some of the best journalists in this country as he paid tribute to the industry. Phandulwazi Jikelo of the Cape Times is the 2023 Journalist of the Year. As the winner of the News photographs category, Jikelo is the first photojournalist to be named Journalist of the Year for many years, as the Journalist of the Year has generally come out of the Investigative or Hard news category. Michelle Banda from Daily Maverick was named the Juby Mayet Rising Star of the Year. Justin Langeveld of News24 and Netwerk24 was named Manager/Publisher of the Year. The Allan Soga/Standard Bank Chairman’s Lifetime Achievement went to Eusebius McKaiser, who recently passed away. All category winners received the coveted Sikuvile Journalism Award Trophy, certificate, and R15 000 prize money. All finalists receive certificates.
